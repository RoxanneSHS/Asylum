@3    = ~Bard's Bane +5
This weapon was forged by the Zhentarium with the intention of being used in a conflict with the Harpers.  The weapon was never used, however, as the predicted war for which Bard's Bane was forged never occured.  It is unknown how this weapon left the Zhentarium Stronghold, but it is predicted that a thief stole the weapon after watching a very poor production of 'Midsummer Night's Dream.'  This theory has a basis, as one of the most charismatic performers was found dead, all traces of his formerly comely visage gone.  The actor recieved a typical beggar's funeral.

@4    = ~These swords are usually referred to as doubled-edged swords, war swords, or military swords.  In many cases, the long sword has a single-edged blade. There is no single version of the long sword; the design and length vary from culture to culture, and may vary within the same culture depending on the era.  Among the most common characteristics of all long swords is their length, which ranges from 35 inches to 47 inches.  In the latter case, the blade is known to take up 40 inches of the total length.  Most long swords have a double-edged blade and a sharp point at the tip.  Despite the tip, the long sword is designed for slashing, not thrusting.

@5    = ~Heart of Braldain +5~
@6    = ~Heart of Braldain +5
Braldain was an infamous dark elf necromancer who happened to have a very painful history.  He achieved great power while travelling the continents, but few knew the pain that his heart bore.

Braldain had long been tormented by the memory of multiple elven women and that proved to be his ultimate downfall.  Eventually, he began torturing the few maidens that he found around his hometown in order to acquire their life energies to power the greatest of all the necromantic spells.

What happened to cause his downfall is all pure speculation, but rumor has it that he was involved in a quest for power when he simply disappeared.  This sword is all that has been discovered of his legacy, and what a legacy it is.  This sword contains the essence of the necromancer's dark heart, still scarred with the memories of the horrible tortures inflicted upon all those women.

This ring was a wedding gift from Breudayael D'Sorpal upon marriage to Anastacia.  The great mage forged it himself, and it contains the essence of one of the greatest emotions known to man.  Breudayael is no fool, however.  He created the ring specifically for this one elf, and it may prove unwise for anyone else to wear it.
